# [Test Server Configs](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-test)

[![Lint](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-test/workflows/Lint/badge.svg)](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-test/actions?query=workflow%3ALint)

**Test Server Configs** is a collection of test scripts for server validation.


## Getting Started

This repository contains unit tests suites helping validate correctness of a server.
Some steps are required to make them ready to run.


## Usage

### GitHub Actions

#### Pre-requisites
Create a workflow `.yml` file in your repositories `.github/workflows` directory.
An [example workflow](#example-workflow) is available below.
For more information, reference the GitHub Help Documentation for
[Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).

#### Inputs
See [action.yml](action.yml).
For more information on these inputs, see the [API Documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#input-2).

#### Example workflow

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v
  - name: Test with server-configs-test
    uses: h5bp/server-configs-test@main
    with:
      command: test
      server: nginx
      root-path: /var/www/server.localhost
      certs-path: /etc/nginx/certs
      configs-volumes: test/vhosts:/etc/nginx/conf.d;h5bp:/etc/nginx/h5bp;nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf;mime.types:/etc/nginx/mime.types
      tests: basic-file-access;caching;cache-busting;custom-errors;forbidden-files;precompressed-files-gzip;rewrites;ssl
```

### Standalone

* Get the files ready by either:
  * Downloading [latest release](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-test/releases/latest) build
  * Generating fixtures
    ```
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```
* Install [k6](https://k6.io/)
* Setup the server, local or Docker
  * Add these hosts:
    - `server.localhost`
    - `www.server.localhost`
    - `secure.server.localhost`
    - `www.secure.server.localhost`
  * Secure `secure.` hosts, possibly with certs within `certs/`
  * Mount `fixtures/` to be the root of files served by the server
* Run the units (see [Usage](#usage))


### Tests

To run all tests, execute:

```sh
$ k6 run lib/index.js
```

To run only specific tests, use the environment variable `TESTS` with all wanted
test names separated by `:` as value.

The environment variable can be passed as an argument:

```sh
$ k6 run lib/index.js -e TESTS=basic-file-access:rewrites
```

#### `basic-file-access`
   
Check if all common files are served correctly.

The requested file should be served exactly as expected, all HTTP headers should be valid.

#### `cache-busting`

Check if cache-busting is working.

The requests that contain a hashed-key extension prefix (`[name].[hash].[ext]`)
should serve the target file correctly.

#### `concatenation`

Check if concatenation is working.

The requests for `[name].combined.[ext]` should be served as a concatenation of 
he `a.[ext]` and `b.[ext]` files.

#### `custom-errors`

Check if errors are served as desired.

The erroneous requests should be served with the custom document provided.

#### `enforce-gzip`

Check if gzip is enable even if mangled headers.

#### `forbidden-files`

Check if forbidden files are well handled.

The requests should be answered with 403 errors when:
* The requested directory does not contain a default document (no file listing);
* The requested directory is hidden (the name start with a dot);
* The requested file is hidden (the name start with a dot);
* The above requests are made in the `.well-known` directory;
* The requested file is known to contain sensitive data.

#### `precompressed-files-(gzip|brotli)`

Check if server use gzip/brotli precompressed-files if available.

The requests should be served with a valid gzip/brotli file if a precompressed-files is available.

#### `rewrites`

Check redirection behavior.

The redirection should follow the following paths:
* Redirect to no-www when the host is prefixed with `www.` but require not to;
* Redirect to www when the host is not prefixed with `www.` but require to;
* Redirect to www/no-www whichever the connexion is secure or not.
* Always redirect HTTP to HTTPS whatever is the host if secure alternatives exists;

#### `ssl`

Check correctness for the TLS/SSL configuration.

The requests should be served with:
* A technically valid certificate;
* A secure TLS version;
* A valid and secure cipher suite;
* A secure protocol (HTTP/2);
* With a well formatted HSTS header.

#### `benchmark`

Bonus test file to run a load benchmark.
This test is not included in the run-all script.
A separate command is required to run it:

```sh
$ k6 run lib/benchmark.js
```
